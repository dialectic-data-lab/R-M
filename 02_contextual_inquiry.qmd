title: "Contextual Inquiry"
---

A semi-structured interview method conducted in the user's own environment while they work, combining observation with directed conversation.

### Description

Contextual Inquiry is a field research method that combines ethnographic observation with directed interviewing, conducted in the user's actual environment while they work. Based on the master-apprentice model of learning, it positions the researcher as an apprentice learning from the user (the master) about their work.
The method emphasizes understanding work in context, focusing on the details of work practice rather than abstract discussions. It was developed by Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt in the 1990s as part of Contextual Design methodology, though it draws on earlier anthropological and cognitive psychology approaches.

### Key Characteristics

-   Master-apprentice model of learning

-   Conducted in user's actual context

-   Focuses on work practice and real behaviors

-   Combines observation with in-the-moment inquiry

### Variations

-   Full contextual inquiry - shadowing

-   Shortened version - limited observations

-   Remote contextual inquiry

### Resources

-   1-2 researchers

-   Recording equipment

-   Note-taking materials

-   Interview guide

## Research Application

-   When to Use:

    -   Early in the design process

    -   When understanding current workflows

    -   Discovering unstated needs

    -   Validating assumed user behaviors

-   Research Questions It Can Answer:

    -   How do users actually perform their work?

    -   What are the unstated needs and workarounds?

    -   What is the real context of use?

    -   What environmental factors impact the work?

-   Types of Insights:

    -   Work patterns and sequences

    -   Environmental constraints

    -   Tool usage patterns

    -   Collaboration patterns

    -   Workarounds and pain points

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

-   Known Issues:

    -   Participant performing for observer

    -   Missing key details while note-taking

    -   Getting sidetracked in conversation

-   Solutions:

    -   Clear introduction and expectations

    -   Two-person research team when possible

    -   Structured observation guide

    -   Regular redirection to actual work
