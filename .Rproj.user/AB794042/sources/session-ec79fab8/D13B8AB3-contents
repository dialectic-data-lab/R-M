title: "PReparing Stimuli"
---

Creating, organizing, and validating research materials such as prototypes, scenarios, data sets, and task guides that participants will interact with during research sessions.

### Description

Research Stimuli Preparation involves the methodical development and validation of materials needed to conduct effective research sessions. This method ensures that all materials are appropriate, consistent, and aligned with research objectives while minimizing potential bias or confusion.

This method bridges research design and execution by creating the tangible tools and materials that participants will engage with. It includes preparing everything from high-fidelity prototypes to discussion guides, ensuring materials are both rigorous enough for research purposes and accessible for participants.

Stimuli preparation typically occurs after research design but before pilot testing, with refinements made based on pilot feedback and stakeholder input.

### Examples of materials that may need to be prepared

-   Prototype preparation and validation

-   Task scenario development

-   Usability testing protocol

-   Discussion guides

-   Visual aids

-   Interactive prototypes

-   Accessibility checking

-   Translation and localization

-   Pilot testing materials

-   Version control management

### Planning Questions To Be Answered

-   What materials are needed for each research activity?

-   How do we ensure materials are unbiased?

-   What fidelity level is appropriate?

-   How do we maintain consistency across materials?

-   What backup options are needed?

-   How do we handle different languages or cultures?

-   What technical requirements exist?

-   How do we validate material effectiveness?

-   What accessibility considerations exist?

-   How do we manage iterations and versions?
