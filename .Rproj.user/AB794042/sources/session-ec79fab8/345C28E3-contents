title: "Introduction to User Research Methods"
---

This compilation represents a systematic categorization of methodological approaches employed in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and user research. Rather than serving as a prescriptive guide, this reference work aims to establish a comprehensive taxonomy of research methods that have emerged and evolved within our field.

## Purpose and Context

The methodological landscape of user research has expanded significantly as digital technologies have become increasingly embedded in social and organizational contexts. This collection addresses the need for a structured framework to understand and access this diverse methodological toolkit. It particularly focuses on methods that have demonstrated empirical validity and practical utility in technology-oriented research settings.

## Organizational Framework

The methods are systematically classified according to several key dimensions:

-   **Data Type Classification**: Distinguishing between qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method approaches
-   **Mode of Investigation**: Categorizing methods by their primary investigative approach (e.g., Direct Elicitation, Observation, Tool-based)
-   **Research Stage Application**: Identifying where in the research process each method is most appropriately deployed
-   **Methodological Rigor**: Emphasizing established methods while acknowledging emerging approaches

## Practical Application

This reference work is designed to support: - Research design and planning - Methodological triangulation - Cross-functional alignment in research initiatives - Academic-industry knowledge transfer

The accompanying flash card system provides a pragmatic tool for research planning and methodological brainstorming, particularly valuable for early-career researchers and practitioners transitioning between different research contexts.

## Notes on Usage

When consulting this reference, consider:

1.  The contextual appropriateness of methods
2.  The resource implications of different methodological choices.
3.  The complementarity between different approaches
4.  The evolution of methods in response to technological change

The classification presented here should be viewed as dynamic rather than definitive, acknowledging that methodological innovation continues to shape our field's investigative capabilities.

This organizational framework contributes to the ongoing discourse on research methodology in HCI by:

-   Providing a structured overview of the methodological landscape

-   Facilitating methodological decision-making

-   Supporting pedagogical objectives in research methods education

-   Encouraging methodological rigor in both academic and industry contexts

We welcome feedback on this approach sp we can continue to refine it to reflect our growing collective expertise and emerging research practices.
