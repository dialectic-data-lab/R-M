Managing the operational aspects of research execution, including participant recruitment, scheduling, tools management, and day-to-day logistics to ensure smooth research implementation.

### Description

Research Operations (ResearchOps) focuses on creating and maintaining the infrastructure and processes needed for efficient research execution. It standardizes operational processes, manages research resources, and ensures consistent quality in research implementation.

This method establishes the operational backbone that enables researchers to focus on research activities rather than administrative tasks. It includes managing participant recruitment, maintaining research tools and systems, coordinating schedules, and ensuring compliance with procedures and policies.

ResearchOps typically operates continuously, supporting multiple research projects simultaneously while maintaining and improving operational efficiency over time.

### Typical Activities

-   Participant recruitment and management
