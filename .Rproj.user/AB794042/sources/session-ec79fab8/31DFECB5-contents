## Experiment Design and Developing Protocols

Structuring research studies that defines the appropriate methods, sampling strategy, and protocols to effectively answer research questions and test hypotheses.

## Description

Research Design is a critical planning method that transforms research goals and questions into structured, executable research plans. It focuses on selecting appropriate methodologies, defining sampling strategies, and creating detailed protocols that ensure research validity and reliability.

This method combines scientific rigor with practical constraints to create robust research approaches that can be consistently executed. It includes determining appropriate methods, sample sizes, and data collection approaches while accounting for potential biases and limitations.

Research Design typically occurs after goal setting and project planning but before detailed operational planning, though it may be iteratively refined based on pilot studies or changing requirements.
