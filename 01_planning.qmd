title: "Project Planning"
---

Organizing research activities, resources, and partnerships to effectively execute research initiatives while managing constraints and stakeholder relationships.

### Description

Project Planning is a comprehensive approach to organizing and coordinating all elements needed for successful research execution. It focuses on resource allocation, budget management, partnership development, and securing necessary permissions while ensuring alignment with research goals and organizational constraints.

This method coordinates the practical aspects of research implementation, from team composition and budget allocation to building essential partnerships and securing data access. It creates a foundation for sustainable research operations that can adapt to changing needs and constraints.

Project Planning typically occurs after goal setting but before detailed research design, though it may require updates throughout the project lifecycle as requirements and partnerships evolve.

### Typical Activities

-   Resource capacity planning and allocation

-   Budget development and tracking

-   Partnership identification and development
