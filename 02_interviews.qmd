title: "Interviews"
---

A systematic method of gathering qualitative data through structured or semi-structured conversations with users, stakeholders, or subject matter experts.

## Description

User interviews are a fundamental research method in UX that involves direct conversation with participants to gather insights about their experiences, needs, behaviors, and attitudes. The method draws from social science interviewing techniques, particularly qualitative research methods developed in sociology and anthropology.

This method stands out for its flexibility and depth, allowing researchers to explore both anticipated and unexpected areas of interest through careful questioning and active listening. Unlike surveys or quantitative methods, interviews enable researchers to probe deeper into responses, clarify ambiguities, and observe non-verbal cues.

Interviews can range from highly structured to completely unstructured, though semi-structured interviews are most common in UX research. This approach uses a prepared interview guide while allowing for spontaneous follow-up questions and exploration of emerging themes. The method's theoretical foundation combines elements of cognitive psychology, conversation analysis, and grounded theory approaches to qualitative research.

## Key Characteristics

-   Observable non-verbal communication

## Variations

-   Structured interviews - fixed questions in fixed order

-   Semi-structured interviews - guided but flexible conversations

-   Unstructured interviews - conversational, minimal guidance

-   Expert interviews - focused on domain knowledge

-   Ethnographic interviews - conducted in context
